Welcome to the Future of Houston Small Business Operations
Strategic AI for Visionary Brands, Led by Houston’s #1 AI Marketing Oracle — TENGU 100X.

I'm Tengu Muna — a Strategic AI Consultant and Visionary Coach who’s spent decades navigating complex operational challenges. While my roots are deep in global clinical research (where efficiency is life-or-death), I've witnessed firsthand how all small businesses are slowed down by outdated systems, repetitive tasks, and the constant struggle of "wearing too many hats."

That's why I decided to do something radical:

⚙️ Although I come from a non-coding background, I taught myself to harness the power of AI tools like OpenAI's GPTs and simultaneously immersed myself in learning practical application. Every solution I design reflects my commitment to practical, elegant AI tools that solve real problems for real business owners.

These are real-world, AI-assisted tools for daily business management, built from the lens of someone who’s led global operations, managed complex projects, and lived the bottlenecks. My mission is to empower Houston's mom-and-pop shops, independent professionals, and growing enterprises with intuitive AI systems that simplify complexity and supercharge their potential.

🛠️ What You’ll Find Here

A growing collection of AI-driven solutions designed to automate administrative tasks, enhance marketing, and streamline operations for small businesses.
